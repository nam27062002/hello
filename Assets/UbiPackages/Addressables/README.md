UbiAddressables
This is a simplified implementation of Addressables system that Unity Technologies plans to release in the second half of 2019. This system provides you with a level of abstraction that makes your code asset location agnostic,
which will allow you to change the location of your assets without no changes in your code. Have a look at https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.addressables@0.4/manual/index.html in order to have a more precise idea of
the system that inspired UbiAddressables system.
