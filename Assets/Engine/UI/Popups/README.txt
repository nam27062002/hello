Default popup animations.

Popups must keep the structure defined in the template prefab in order to animate properly.

Feel free to create your own animations and replace these via an AnimatorOverrideController component (see http://pekalicious.com/blog/unity3d-reusing-animator-controllers-with-animatoroverridecontroller/).
